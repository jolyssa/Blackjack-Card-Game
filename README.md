## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a simple yet engaging Blackjack game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to experience the thrill of playing Blackjack in a condensed manner. The project demonstrates key programming concepts such as the single-threaded nature of JavaScript, object-oriented design, and the use of modern array methods.


## Lessons Learned:

Since this is one my beginner JavaScript projects, it taught me a lot about how this language works.

 Here are some key things I picked up:

### 1) Single-threaded Nature of JavaScript:

I learned how JavaScript runs synchronously, with operations happening one after the other, unless I introduce asynchronous code.


### 2) Functions and Flow Control:

I got a better understanding of how to structure functions and how they can depend on each other. For example, my function to check if Player won the game had to run after functions for dealing cards and calculating scores.


### 3) Objects and Object-Oriented Programming:

Creating and working with objects, like players, taught me how to store and organise game data and how objects interact with each other.


### 4) Arrays and Array Methods:

I used methods like .push() to manage Player's deck, and I learned how to manipulate arrays effectively for different parts of the game.


### 5) For Loops and Iteration:

I found new ways to use for loops, such as handling the cards in a player’s hand.


### 6) Conditional Logic:

Writing the game logic was fun because I used a lot of if-else statements to manage different scenarios in the game, like when a player loses or wins.


### 7) Boolean Logic:

Working with Boolean values was crucial for checking if certain conditions were met, like when a player’s score exceeded 21 or if the game should continue.


### 8) DOM Manipulation:

I learned more about how to update the webpage with the current game status by interacting with the DOM, displaying cards, and showing scores.


### 9) Debugging and Problem Solving:

Most importantly, I learned how to debug my code and problem-solve when things didn’t work as expected. This was a huge part of the learning process.

Overall, building Blackjack helped me grasp core JavaScript concepts in a fun and practical way!
